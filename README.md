# summarizer-flask-app-gcloud
In this repo I realized a small stand-alone app using the flask framework, for performing automatic text summarization. The application is configured to be deployed on Google 
Cloud app engine. 
(hopefully soon) I will write a small guide to describe, the algorithm, some code details, and about the technical stuff to make the code working on Gcloud
